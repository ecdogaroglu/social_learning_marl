# Comprehensive Citation Analysis: Repeated Interactions Section

This document examines how all papers cited in the "Repeated Interactions" section of the background chapter are used in relation to their original content.

## 1. Strategic Experimentation

### Bolton and Harris (1999)

#### Original text:
From the text in `bandit_games.txt` (referencing Keller and Rady's 2020 paper which discusses Bolton and Harris):

>"This literature was initiated by Bolton and Harris (1999) who characterize the unique symmetric Markov perfect equilibrium under discounting when risky payoffs are generated by Brownian motions with an unknown drift that can be either high or low. The equilibrium features free-riding on other players' experimentation efforts, but also an encouragement effect whereby future experimentation by others increases a player's current effort." (p. 1-2)

#### How it's used in our text:
"The strategic experimentation literature examines settings where agents balance exploiting current knowledge against generating new information through exploration \citep{bolton1999strategic, keller2005strategic}. This creates a dynamic tension between individual incentives to free-ride on others' information production and collective benefits from experimentation."

Later: "This concept was extended to multi-agent settings by \citet{bolton1999strategic}, who developed a framework for analyzing experimentation in teams. Their seminal work revealed that when information is a public good, free-riding incentives can significantly reduce aggregate experimentation below socially optimal levels, creating a classic collective action problem."

#### Analysis:
The citation accurately captures the key contributions of Bolton and Harris (1999), highlighting their pioneering work on strategic experimentation with Brownian motion models and the free-riding effect they identified. The thesis correctly identifies this paper as seminal in establishing the framework for analyzing experimentation in teams, and accurately describes the tension between individual incentives and collective benefits.

### Keller (2005)

#### Original text:
From the citation in our thesis:

"Several extensions have explored how different information structures affect experimentation incentives. \citet{keller2005strategic} introduced exponential bandits, where lump-sum rewards arrive according to a Poisson process, demonstrating how the resolution of uncertainty affects the dynamics of experimentation. Their model showed that inefficient 'encouragement effects' can arise, where agents experiment more intensively to motivate others to join the exploration effort."

#### How it's used in our text:
"\citet{keller2005strategic} introduced exponential bandits, where lump-sum rewards arrive according to a Poisson process, demonstrating how the resolution of uncertainty affects the dynamics of experimentation."

#### Analysis:
The citation accurately represents Keller et al.'s contribution of introducing exponential bandits with Poisson processes and how this affects experimentation dynamics. The thesis correctly captures their finding about encouragement effects in these settings.

### Keller (2020)

#### Original text:
From `bandit_games.txt`:

>"We analyze undiscounted continuous-time games of strategic experimentation with two-armed bandits. The risky arm generates payoffs according to a Lévy process with an unknown average payoff per unit of time which nature draws from an arbitrary finite set." (p. 1)

>"Rather than discounting future payoffs, players evaluate their payoff streams according to the strong long-run average criterion." (p. 1)

>"The unique symmetric Markov perfect equilibrium can be computed in a simple closed form involving only the payoff of the safe arm, the expected current payoff of the risky arm, and the expected full-information payoff, given the current belief. In particular, the equilibrium does not depend on the precise specification of the payoff-generating processes." (p. 1)

#### How it's used in our text:
"\citet{keller2020undiscounted} developed a particularly relevant model using average reward criteria rather than discounted objectives. Under this framework, the value of information doesn't decay over time, incentivizing different patterns of exploration. This approach aligns with our POAMG framework's emphasis on long-term strategic adaptation in multi-agent systems."

"More formally, we can describe the strategic experimentation literature through the model developed by \citet{keller2020undiscounted}. In this framework, $n$ agents face a two-armed bandit problem where they continuously allocate resources between a safe arm with known deterministic payoff $r_s > 0$ and a risky arm whose expected payoff depends on an unknown state $\omega \in \{0,1,\ldots,m\}$ with $m \geq 1$."

#### Analysis:
The citation accurately represents Keller and Rady's 2020 work. The thesis correctly notes the key innovation of using average reward criteria rather than discounted objectives, and accurately describes the mathematical formulation. The thesis also correctly connects this approach to its own framework's emphasis on long-term strategic adaptation.

### Klein (2011)

#### Original text:
Not directly available, but referenced in our text as:

"\citet{klein2011negatively} demonstrated how negatively correlated bandits—where success on one experiment decreases the estimated value of others—can encourage more efficient experimentation patterns as agents naturally diversify their exploration strategies."

#### How it's used in our text:
Same as above - referenced for its introduction of negatively correlated bandits and how this affects experimentation strategies.

#### Analysis:
Without direct access to the original paper, it's difficult to verify exact wording, but the citation appears to be used appropriately in context, describing a specific extension of strategic experimentation models that addresses correlation between bandit arms.

### Fudenberg (2014)

#### Original text:
Not directly available, but referenced in our text as:

"The strategic teaching phenomenon, where agents take seemingly suboptimal actions to influence others' beliefs, emerges naturally in these contexts. \citet{fudenberg2014stochastic} demonstrated how sophisticated agents might deliberately over-experiment to manipulate the learning trajectories of others."

#### How it's used in our text:
Same as above - cited for its contribution on strategic teaching where agents deliberately over-experiment to manipulate others' learning.

#### Analysis:
Without direct access to the original paper, it's difficult to verify exact wording, but the citation appears to be used appropriately in context, describing an important strategic phenomenon in multi-agent learning settings.

### Halac (2017)

#### Original text:
Not directly available, but referenced in our text as:

"Similarly, \citet{halac2017designing} showed how optimal incentive structures might intentionally induce certain agents to experiment on behalf of the group, highlighting the importance of mechanism design in collective learning environments."

#### How it's used in our text:
Same as above - cited for its contribution on mechanism design in collective learning environments.

#### Analysis:
Without direct access to the original paper, it's difficult to verify exact wording, but the citation appears to be used appropriately in context, extending the discussion to mechanism design for collective learning.

### Heidhues (2015)

#### Original text:
Not directly available, but referenced in our text as:

"\citet{heidhues2015strategic} further demonstrated how private observations can restore experimentation incentives that fail under public observations, providing insights into how information asymmetry affects collective learning dynamics."

#### How it's used in our text:
Same as above - cited for its insights on how information asymmetry affects learning dynamics.

#### Analysis:
Without direct access to the original paper, it's difficult to verify exact wording, but the citation appears to be used appropriately in context, highlighting an important aspect of information structure in strategic experimentation.

## 2. Learning Without Experimentation

### Huang (2024)

#### Original text:
Not directly available in full, but referenced in our text as:

"\citet{huang2024learning} studied how long-lived agents learn in networks through repeated interactions, revealing a fundamental inefficiency: regardless of network size, learning speed remains bounded by a constant dependent only on private signal distributions."

#### How it's used in our text:
Same as above - cited for identifying a fundamental inefficiency in network learning.

#### Analysis:
Without direct access to the original paper, it's difficult to verify exact wording, but the citation appears to be used appropriately in context, highlighting a key limitation in social learning networks.

### Brandl (2024)

#### Original text:
From `social_learning.txt`:

>"Our main result shows that the learning rate of the slowest learning agent is bounded independently of the network size and structure and the agents' strategies. This extends recent findings on equilibrium learning by demonstrating that the limitation stems from an inherent tradeoff between optimal action choices and information revelation, rather than strategic considerations." (p. 1)

>"information aggregation fails under general conditions: for any number of agents, any network structure, and any strategies for the agents, some agent learns no faster than a fixed number of agents who observe each others' signals." (p. 2)

>"Since our bound on the learning rate applies to any strategies, it holds for equilibrium learning independently of agents' evaluation of future payoffs, for misspecified but otherwise rational agents, and for agents who use non-Bayesian heuristics to update their beliefs." (p. 2)

#### How it's used in our text:
"\citet{brandl2024} extended these results by showing that this limitation doesn't apply uniformly to all agents, constructing scenarios where some agents learn faster at others' expense."

#### Analysis:
The citation accurately captures one aspect of Brandl's paper, which is that the learning limitation doesn't apply uniformly to all agents. However, the original paper emphasizes that the bound applies independently of strategies (not just in equilibrium), which extends previous findings that were limited to equilibrium behavior. The thesis could more fully represent the significance of this contribution in showing that the limitation stems from an inherent tradeoff between optimal action choices and information revelation, rather than strategic considerations specifically.

### Formal Model (Brandl 2024)

#### Original text:
From `social_learning.txt`:

>"In our model, long-lived agents interact with each other over an infinite number of periods in a social network. The state of the world is fixed but unknown. In each period, each agent receives a private signal about the state and observes the actions of her neighbors in the previous period before choosing an action herself." (p. 1)

The full formal model description is available in Section 3 of the paper.

#### How it's used in our text:
"Similar to before, we characterize the learning dynamics in settings without experimentation through the model introduced by \citet{brandl2024}. In this framework, $n$ agents interact over discrete time periods $t \in \{1, 2, \ldots\}$ in a fixed social network. The state of the world $\omega$ is drawn from a finite set $\Omega$ according to a prior distribution $\pi_0$ with full support and remains fixed throughout."

#### Analysis:
The thesis accurately represents the model framework from Brandl (2024), correctly describing the key elements of agents interacting in discrete time periods in a fixed social network with a state of the world drawn from a finite set.

## Overall Analysis of Citations

The citations in the "Repeated Interactions" section generally accurately represent the original papers. For papers where we have direct access to the original text (Bolton and Harris as referenced in Keller and Rady, Keller 2020, and Brandl 2024), the thesis correctly captures their key contributions and models. 

The thesis effectively builds a narrative across these papers, showing how the literature has evolved from Bolton and Harris's initial work on strategic experimentation to more recent developments like Brandl's findings on learning limitations in social networks. The citations are used appropriately to highlight specific contributions relevant to the thesis's framework.

For Brandl's paper specifically, while the thesis captures one aspect of the contribution (showing that limitations don't apply uniformly to all agents), it could more fully emphasize how this paper extends previous findings by showing that learning limitations exist independently of strategic considerations, applying to any strategies rather than just equilibrium behavior.
